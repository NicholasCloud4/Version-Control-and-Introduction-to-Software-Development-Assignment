<p>This is a Java Project that I have created which is a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors!
When the user runs the program it will ask them to type yes in the cmd line of their IDE. 
It will then ask the user to type either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. When they enter their choice 
the computer will then display their choice and it will result in a Win, Draw, or Lose. I have 
commented in the code how this game was made. I had to scan for user input, if else statements were used,
and switch statements so the computer would pick a random option.</p>
